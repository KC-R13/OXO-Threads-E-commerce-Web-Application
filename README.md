# OXO-Threads-E-commerce-Web-Application
I developed this e-commerce web application for academic coursework, tailored for a clothing store. It features user registration/authentication, a sleek product display interface, easy navigation with a product catalogue, shopping cart, checkout options, user reviews, and an admin panel for managing products, orders, users, and reviews.
